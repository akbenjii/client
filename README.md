# client

This is the client-side code for Club Penguin Forever as of when Sahmyool and DirkD left on July 14th. You may use it for learning or personal purposes, for example a private CPPS for you and your friends. No-one may host a public CPPS using this code. 

The current team at CPF have permission to continue building off the code if they wish. If CPF happens to have a change in ownership, the new owners are not allowed to use this code without seeking my permission.

This client is based off https://github.com/wizguin/yukon.

Modifications to the client were made by the following people, in order of how much they contributed

Sahmyool
DirkD
Antonio
Amman

If you wish to host a public CPPS similar to CPF, Yukon is licensed so that anyone can use it commercially.
