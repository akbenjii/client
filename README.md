# client

This is the client-side code for Club Penguin Forever as of when Me and DirkD left on July 14th. You may use it for learning or personal purposes, for example a private CPPS for you and your friends. No-one may host a public CPPS using this code. 

The current team at CPF have permission to continue building off the code if they wish. If CPF happens to have a change in ownership, the new owners are not allowed to use this code without seeking my permission.
